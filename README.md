# Async/Await in JavaScript

`async` and `await` are modern JavaScript features that simplify working with asynchronous code. `async` is used to define a function that always returns a promise. Inside an `async` function, you can use `await` to pause the execution until a promise resolves, making asynchronous code look and behave more like synchronous code.

`await` can only be used within an `async` function and helps avoid the complexity of chaining multiple `.then()` methods or handling nested callbacks. This makes the code cleaner, more readable, and easier to maintain.
